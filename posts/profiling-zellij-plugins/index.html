Especially about performance impact in Rust when memory management is not implemented correctly. In this article I want to share some of these insights.\nIn order to follow the article, please check out the official rust-plugin-example, which I used as a starting point.\nInitial setup This section describes some actions I took to set up the development environment for simplifying the development process.\nDevelopment dependencies Since I’m a big fan of nix and nixOS, I started by creating a shell.nix file, that provides all the dependencies needed for development. It contains a pinned version of the nixpkgs repository, that holds build instructions for used dependencies and their respective versions.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 { pkgs ? import {} }: with pkgs; let pinnedPkgs = fetchFromGitHub { owner = \"NixOS\"; repo = \"nixpkgs\"; rev = \"a63a64b593dcf2fe05f7c5d666eb395950f36bc9\"; sha256 = \"sha256-+ZoAny3ZxLcfMaUoLVgL9Ywb/57wP+EtsdNGuXUJrwg=\"; }; pkgs = import pinnedPkgs {}; inherit (lib) optional optionals; inherit (darwin.apple_sdk.frameworks) Cocoa CoreGraphics Foundation IOKit Kernel OpenGL Security; in pkgs.mkShell rec { buildInputs = with pkgs; [ clang # Replace llvmPackages with llvmPackages_X, where X is the latest LLVM version (at the time of writing, 16) llvmPackages.bintools rustup libiconv watchexec ]; RUSTC_VERSION = pkgs.lib.readFile ./rust-toolchain; # https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen#environment-variables LIBCLANG_PATH = pkgs.lib.makeLibraryPath [ pkgs.llvmPackages_latest.libclang.lib ]; shellHook = '' export PATH=$PATH:''${CARGO_HOME:-~/.cargo}/bin export PATH=$PATH:''${RUSTUP_HOME:-~/.rustup}/toolchains/$RUSTC_VERSION-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/ ''; # Add precompiled library to rustc search path RUSTFLAGS = (builtins.map (a: ''-L ${a}/lib'') [ # add libraries here (e.g. pkgs.libvmi) ]); # Add glibc, clang, glib and other headers to bindgen search path BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS = # Includes with normal include path (builtins.map (a: ''-I\"${a}/include\"'') [ # add dev libraries here (e.g. pkgs.libvmi.dev) pkgs.libiconv ]) # Includes with special directory paths ++ [ ''-I\"${pkgs.llvmPackages_latest.libclang.lib}/lib/clang/${pkgs.llvmPackages_latest.libclang.version}/include\"'' ''-I\"${pkgs.libiconv.out}/lib/\"'' ]; } It will install clang, llvm, rustup, libiconv and watchexec into a nix shell, additionally to configure build dependencies for the rust compiler. To automatically enable usage of these dependencies, I added a .envrc to utilze direnv for automatically loading the nix shell when entering the project directory.\n1 use nix Later on I switched to a flake.nix file to provide a convenient, reproducible and declarative way to build the project.\nTask runner Even if most of the tasks while developing can be done by directly running cargo commands, I start by setting up a justfile, that is used by just, an alternative to make. Then justfile will provide a unified interface to run all the commands needed for development and also lists them conveniently.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 build: cargo build run: build zellij -l ./plugin-dev-workspace.kdl -s zjstatus-dev test: cargo component test -- --nocapture lint: cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings cargo audit release version: cargo set-version {{version}} direnv exec . cargo build --release git commit -am \"chore: bump version to v{{version}}\" git tag -m \"v{{version}}\" v{{version}} git cliff --current Commands can be run by calling just , e.g. just run. The syntax for releases allows to bump the version and create a git tag with a single command: just release 0.1.0.\nSplitting code to binary and library As we want to write tests and benchmarks for the code, we need to split the entrypoint of the plugin from the library code. All parts that we want to test and benchmark need to be part of the library crate. To split the binary from the library, we need to modify the file structure in the following way:\n1 2 src/main.rs -\u003e src/bin/plugin-name.rs # move src/lib.rs # create The current main file will be moved to src/bin/plugin.rs and the src/lib.rs file will be created. src/lib.rs will contain the library code, that contains logic for the plugin. In addition to the directory structure, we need to modify the Cargo.toml file to reflect the changes:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 [[bin]] name = \"plugin-name\" bench = false [lib] bench = false This will prevent cargo from directly running library or binary code, when only benchmarks should be run. It is important to configure the project like that because zellij’s API with register_plugin will try to connect to the running zellij instance, which is not present when running benchmarks. Since all logic related code is now located in the library, we need to import it in the binary or benchmarks with use plugin_name::*;.\nUnit testing For ensuring the correctness of plugin logic and to validate, that the logic works as expected when refactoring the code, I am a big fan of unit testing. It not only helps to ensure correctness, but also provides a way to document the code and its usage. In addition it helps to develop new features in a test driven way, such that the test is written before the actual implementation.\nUnit tests in zellij plugins can be written by adding a #[cfg(test)] attribute to the test module and writing tests with the #[test] attribute - like in any other rust project. You just need to make sure, that code that interacts with zellij’s API is not executed when running tests, as it will fail otherwise. This can be done by using the #[cfg(not(test))] attribute on the code that should not be executed when running tests.\nAnother tricky part is to run the unit tests, as they need to be run within a WebAssembly runtime (like wasmtime). To simplify running the tests, I added cargo-component to the project dependencies, which runs code with wasmtime after it has been compiled. A shortcut for running the tests was also added to the justfile before.\nHere’s an example of a unit test, that verifies the correctness of the parse_color function:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 #[cfg(test)] mod test { use super::*; #[test] fn test_parse_color() { let result = parse_color(\"#010203\"); let expected = RgbColor(1, 2, 3); assert_eq!(result, Some(expected.into())); let result = parse_color(\"255\"); let expected = Ansi256Color(255); assert_eq!(result, Some(expected.into())); let result = parse_color(\"365\"); assert_eq!(result, None); let result = parse_color(\"#365\"); assert_eq!(result, None); } } Benchmarks Benchmarks can be used to check for performance regressions when refactoring code. They can also be used to measure the performance impact of new features. Therefore it is important to store results of the benchmarks, to compare them with future runs.\nNormally, I like to use divan for writing benchmarks, but it does not support WebAssembly yet. Therefore I switched to criterion since it supports WebAssembly and provides some convenient features for storing and comparing benchmark results.\nTo start with benchmarks, first add criterion and the benchmark targets to the Cargo.toml file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 [dev-dependencies] criterion = { version = \"0.5.1\", default-features = false, features = [\"html_reports\"] } [[bench]] name = \"benches\" harness = false Benchmark targets must be named like the benchmark files in the benches directory, e.g. benches/benches.rs.\nFollow the criterion documentation for writing benchmarks. Here’s a quick example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 use criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion}; use zjstatus::render::formatted_parts_from_string_cached; fn bench_formattedparts_from_format_string_cached(c: \u0026mut Criterion) { c.bench_function(\"formatted_parts_from_string_cached\", |b| { b.iter(|| { formatted_parts_from_string_cached( \"#[fg=#9399B2,bg=#181825,bold,italic] {index} {name} [] #[fg=#9399B2,bg=#181825,bold,italic] {index} {name} [] \", ) }) }); } fn criterion_benchmark(c: \u0026mut Criterion) { bench_formattedparts_from_format_string_cached(c); } criterion_group!(benches, criterion_benchmark); criterion_main!(benches); Similar to unit tests we need to make sure that code which interacts with zellij’s API is not executed when running benchmarks. Therefore we need to add a new feature to the Cargo.toml and add the #[cfg(not(feature = \"bench\"))] attribute to the code that should not be executed when running benchmarks.\n1 2 [features] bench = [] Since criterion needs to store benchmark results in the target directory, we cannot run benchmarks with cargo component bench. cargo component bench will not only try to run the plugin wasm binary outside of zellij, but also runs the benchmarks in wasmtime without granting permissions to write to the target directory. Therefore we need to compile benchmarks with cargo bench --target wasm32-wasi --benches --no-run --feature=benches. After compilation it will print the path to the compiled binaries. These binaries then must be executed with wasmtime and the --dir flag to grant permissions to write to the target directory. The following target in the justfile will automate this process:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 bench: #!/usr/bin/env bash benchmarks=\"$(cargo bench --target wasm32-wasi --features=bench --no-run --color=always 2\u003e\u00261 | tee /dev/tty | grep -oP 'target/.*.wasm')\" echo \"$benchmarks\" \\ | xargs -I{} wasmtime --dir $PWD/target::target {} --bench --color=always Since the benchmarks are now able to store the json results in the target directory, criterion is able to compare the result with previous runs.\nThis technique allowed me to improve the performance of zjstatus a lot, after I learned how to better utilize the borrow checker and be aware of memory allocations. To improve performance, I tried to avoid .clone() calls where possible and instead use references, since references are cheap to copy, whereas .clone() needs to allocate memory of the size of the cloned object and copy the data.\n","wordCount":"1648","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-01-01T12:05:02+02:00","dateModified":"2024-01-01T12:05:02+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.nerd.rocks/posts/profiling-zellij-plugins/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"blog.nerd.rocks","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.nerd.rocks/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.nerd.rocks/ accesskey=h title="blog.nerd.rocks (Alt + H)">blog.nerd.rocks</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.nerd.rocks/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.nerd.rocks/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.nerd.rocks/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent" id=a26eda2861e3543cc75dbf7a6825af9a>Learnings from developing a zellij plugin</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-01-01 12:05:02 +0200 +0200'>2024-01-01</span></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#initial-setup aria-label="Initial setup">Initial setup</a><ul><li><a href=#development-dependencies aria-label="Development dependencies">Development dependencies</a></li><li><a href=#task-runner aria-label="Task runner">Task runner</a></li><li><a href=#splitting-code-to-binary-and-library aria-label="Splitting code to binary and library">Splitting code to binary and library</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#unit-testing aria-label="Unit testing">Unit testing</a></li><li><a href=#benchmarks aria-label=Benchmarks>Benchmarks</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Zellij is a terminal multiplexer written in Rust, that aims to provide an intuitive and easy to extend working environment.

It is important to configure the project like that because zellij&rsquo;s API with <code>register_plugin</code> will try to connect to the running zellij instance, which is not present when running benchmarks.
Since all logic related code is now located in the library, we need to import it in the binary or benchmarks with <code>use plugin_name::*;</code>.</p><h2 id=unit-testing>Unit testing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unit-testing>#</a></h2><p>For ensuring the correctness of plugin logic and to validate, that the logic works as expected when refactoring the code, I am a big fan of unit testing.
It not only helps to ensure correctness, but also provides a way to document the code and its usage.
In addition it helps to develop new features in a test driven way, such that the test is written before the actual implementation.</p><p>Unit tests in zellij plugins can be written by adding a <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> attribute to the test module and writing tests with the <code>#[test]</code> attribute - like in any other rust project.
You just need to make sure, that code that interacts with zellij&rsquo;s API is not executed when running tests, as it will fail otherwise.
This can be done by using the <code>#[cfg(not(test))]</code> attribute on the code that should not be executed when running tests.</p><p>Another tricky part is to run the unit tests, as they need to be run within a WebAssembly runtime (like <code>wasmtime</code>).
To simplify running the tests, I added <a href=https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component>cargo-component</a> to the project dependencies, which runs code with <code>wasmtime</code> after it has been compiled.
A shortcut for running the tests was also added to the <code>justfile</code> before.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a unit test, that verifies the correctness of the <code>parse_color</code> function:</p><div class=highlight><div style=color:#cdd6f4;background-color:#1e1e2e;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none><table style=border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><tr><td style=vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#cdd6f4;background-color:#1e1e2e;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none><code><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:.4em;padding:0 .4em;color:#7f849c"> 1
